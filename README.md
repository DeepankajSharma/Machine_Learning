# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine learning 

This project is aimed at developing a machine learning-based solution for detecting credit card fraud. Credit card fraud is a significant issue for financial institutions and cardholders, and accurate detection is crucial to minimize financial losses and protect consumers.

Our solution uses machine learning techniques to analyze credit card transaction data and identify potentially fraudulent transactions. We have employed [Support Vector Machines (SVM)] to achieve this goal. The project focuses on addressing the challenge of class imbalance in the dataset, where fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones.

The dataset I've described contains transaction data from credit cards in September 2013, specifically focusing on two days of transactions. Here are the key characteristics and information about this dataset:

1. **Data Distribution:**
   - The dataset includes 284,807 transactions.
   - There are a total of 492 frauds, making the dataset highly unbalanced.
   - Fraudulent transactions (Class 1) account for only 0.172% of all transactions.

2. **Features:**
   - The dataset primarily consists of numerical input variables.
   - The features V1 through V28 are the result of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation. These are the principal components of the data.
   - The 'Time' feature represents the time elapsed (in seconds) between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
   - The 'Amount' feature represents the transaction amount.
   - The 'Class' feature is the response variable, with a value of 1 indicating a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicating a normal transaction.

3. **Model Choice:**
   - Due to the highly unbalanced nature of the dataset, where frauds are a very small proportion of the data, it is recommended to use evaluation metrics other than accuracy.
   - Accuracy may not be meaningful for unbalanced classification problems like this one.
   - The recommended metric for evaluation is the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), which is more suitable for imbalanced datasets.

4. **Model Selection:**
   - Based on your description, Support Vector Machines (SVM) have shown promise in providing good accuracy on test data for credit card fraud detection. SVM is a popular choice for binary classification tasks and can be effective in handling imbalanced data.

this dataset represents credit card transaction data with a severe class imbalance, where the majority of transactions are normal, and a very small percentage are fraudulent. Due to this imbalance, SVM is suggested as a potential model for detecting fraudulent transactions, and the AUPRC should be used to evaluate its performance instead of traditional accuracy metrics.

## FAQ

1. What is the purpose of this Credit Card Fraud Detection project?

   Ans: This project aims to develop a machine learning-based solution for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions to protect both financial institutions and cardholders.

2. What machine learning models are used for fraud detection?

   Ans: We primarily use Support Vector Machines (SVM) have shown promise in providing good accuracy on test data for credit card fraud detection.

3.What evaluation metrics are used to assess the model's performance?

Ans: We use the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) as the primary evaluation metric for assessing the model's performance on this highly imbalanced dataset. 
Details about the evaluation:
Train score: {'logistic_regression': 0.7913279132791328, 
'Naive Bayes': 0.92547425474254
74, 
'SVM': 0.93125}
Test score: {'logistic_regression': 0.8089430894308943, 'Naive Bayes': 0.88617886178861
79, 'SVM': 0.9007777777777777}
from above we conclude that SVM(Support vetor machine) give more accuracy on test data so we can say
that we use SVM for credit card fraud Detection
